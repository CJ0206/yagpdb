# Mod Menu

This is custom code for [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz/) which will give moderators a handy menu to kick, ban, or mute users in [Discord](https://discord.com/). Rather than remembering various bot commands, roles, or clicking various menus moderators can just type `-mod <@user>` and the bot will reply with an embed to carry out the necessary task.

Once you are done with the pannel make sure to click "‚ùå" to close out the operation, this will remove the invoaction and embed.

## Setting up the bot

Go to the *cutom commnads* tab in your [YAGPDB](https://yagpdb.xyz/) dashboard, I suggest creating a group called something like `Mod Menu` to keep them in nice groups.
- Click `Create a new Custom Command`
- Select `Trigger Type` and choose `Command (mention/cmd prefix)` and decide on your trigger, in our example we will use `mod`
- Copy the code from the [command](https://github.com/CJ0206/yagpdb-cc/blob/main/Mod%20Menu/command.luaa) file and paste it into `Response`
- Save

- Click `Create a new Custom Command`
- Select `Trigger Type` and choose `Reaction` and `Added + Removed reactions`
- Copy the code from the [reactions](https://github.com/CJ0206/yagpdb-cc/blob/main/Mod%20Menu/reactions.lua) file and paste it into `Response`
- Save

## Customising the code

**If you wish to cutomise any of the code here you must ensure you update both files**, for example, I have updated the ban and mute emoji which was chaned in several places in both documents. If you update an emoji it's probably best to use the find (`ctrl`+`F`) function and replace every instance of that emoji in both documents, please note the sub menus are only in the [reactions](https://github.com/CJ0206/yagpdb-cc/blob/main/Mod%20Menu/reactions.lua) document.

If you wish to change the time limits people are muted/banned for then I suggest searching the [reactions](https://github.com/CJ0206/yagpdb-cc/blob/main/Mod%20Menu/reactions.lua) document for the corresponding emoji updating the text.

## How to use the bot

Just type `[prefix]mod [@user]` to moderate `[@user]`.
