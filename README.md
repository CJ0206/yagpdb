# YAGPDB

Here is a collection of custom commands I use for [YAGPDB (Yet Another General Purpose Discord Bot)](https://yagpdb.xyz/), I am using this as a repository to save and document what the various custom commands do for me in a way I can understand.

I did not write the majority of these so please check out the **Attribution** section on each page and make sure you give the creator any kudos, I've mearly added to or amended their code for my purposes, or just written a better explination and documentation for me.

## [AFK System](https://github.com/CJ0206/yagpdb-cc/tree/main/AFK)

Let others know when you are away from [Discord](https://discord.com/) by letting the bot tell them why you are away, and how long you will be.

## [Reaction Giveaway](https://github.com/CJ0206/yagpdb-cc/tree/main/Reaction%20Giveaway)

A quick way to create a reaction giveaway for [Discord](https://discord.com/). Members just select the emoji and they are entered into the giveaway, you can set how long the giveaway will run for, the number of winners, the maximum entrants, and even type the code in one channel and post the giveaway to another.

## [Sticky Messages](https://github.com/CJ0206/yagpdb/tree/main/Sticky%20Message)

Set a message which will stick to the bottom of a [Discord](https://discord.com/) channel through a custom embed, no matter how many people send messages in the channel this embed will be moved to the bottom after `x` amount of time to ensure important information is not missed.

## [Suggestions](https://github.com/CJ0206/yagpdb/tree/main/Suggestions)

Take a suggestion and turn it into a custom embed with voting buttons, there is also the option to automatically delete anything which isn't a suggestion from the channel.
