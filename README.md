# YAGPDB

Here is a collection of custom commands I use for [YAGPDB (Yet Another General Purpose Discord Bot)](https://yagpdb.xyz/), I am using this as a repository to save and document what the various custom commands do for me in a way I can understand.

I did not write the majority of these so please check out the **Attribution** section on each page and make sure you give the creator any kudos, I've mearly added to or amended their code for my purposes, or just written a better explination and documentation for me.

## [Sticky Messages](https://github.com/CJ0206/yagpdb/tree/main/Sticky%20Message)

Set a message which will stick to the bottom of a [Discord](https://discord.com/) channel through a custom embed, no matter how many people send messages in the channel this embed will be moved to the bottom after `x` amount of time to ensure important information is not missed.

## [Suggestions](https://github.com/CJ0206/yagpdb/tree/main/Suggestions)

Take a suggestion and turn it into a custom embed with voting buttons, there is also the option to automatically delete anything which isn't a suggestion from the channel.
